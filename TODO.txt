* update docstrings
  	 * definitely check set_angle_sweep() docstring. it is snarky.
* fix get_bandpass_statistics() in simulator.py
* include bandpass statistics in run_sim() output file
* inclide dielectric loss as a primary run_sim() output (like 'T', 'R', and "Frequency')
* include handling off-normal angles of incidence
* double-check bandpass plotting. it's probably broken :(
* fix logging for theta sweeps
* fix results return for theta sweeps. right now quick plotting is broken bc plotter.load_data() doesn't get any meaningful input
