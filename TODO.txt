* update docstrings
  	 * definitely check set_angle_sweep() docstring. it is snarky.
* include bandpass statistics in run_sim() output file
* inclide dielectric loss as a primary run_sim() output (like 'T', 'R', and "Frequency')
* include handling off-normal angles of incidence
* double-check bandpass plotting. it's probably broken :(
