CHANGES FOR v0.1.4

* update docstrings
  	 * definitely check set_angle_sweep() docstring. it is snarky.
* COMPLETED 9/19/16 - fix get_bandpass_statistics() in simulator.py
* COMPLETED 9/19/16 - include bandpass statistics in run_sim() output file
* inclide dielectric loss as a primary run_sim() output (like 'T', 'R', and "Frequency')
* COMPLETED 9/16/16 - include handling off-normal angles of incidence
* double-check bandpass plotting. it's probably broken :(
* COMPLETED 9/17/16 - fix logging for theta sweeps
* fix results return for theta sweeps. right now quick plotting is broken bc plotter.load_data() doesn't get any meaningful input
* review _unpolarized_simulation(). is it still useful in its current form?
* ADD TO HEADER
      	 * COMPLETED 9/19/16 - date stamp
* think of different way to handle angle sweep outputs. maybe log the header for each angle, but pickle the output so there's just two  files instead of several.
