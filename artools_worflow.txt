Ok, here's a quick guide to simulating with artools.

1) Import the package
   ex: import artools as ar

2) Create a Builder() object. Builder() handles most of the background functionality of the simulator.
   ex: b = simulator.Builder()

3) Choose the freq sweep range. Give the bounds in GHz. Defaults 1 GHz steps.
   ex: b.set_freq_sweep(0., 300.)

4) Choose your SourceLayer() and TerminatorLayer(). These default to 'vacuum' and 'alumina' and should be good enough for most work.

5) Create a Layer() object. Or create many Layer() objects. Then set their thicknesses in meters.
   ex: eptfe = core.Layer('eptfe')
       ro3035 = core.Layer('ro3035')
       eps7 = core.Layer('ideal7')

       eptfe.thickness = 15.0*2.54e-5	# that's 15 mils x mils to meters conversion factor
       ro3035.thickness = 5.6*2.54e-5
       eps7.ideal_thickness()		# calling 'ideal_thickness' calculates the ideal 1/4 lambda thickness for that dielectric at 150 GHz

6) Put your layers in a list and connect them.
   ex: ar_stack = [eptfe, ro3035, eps7]
       b.interconnect(ar_stack)

7) Run sim.
   ex: b.run_sim()
